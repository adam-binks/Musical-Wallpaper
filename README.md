# Musical Wallpaper
Turn your favourite albums on Spotify into your new favourite desktop wallpaper

You just supply the URL of a playlist (make your own or use someone else's) containing your favourite album covers. Musical Wallpaper downloads the album covers using the Spotify API, then stitches them together into wallpapers. You can specify the size of the album artwork to fit more onscreen.

# Download and run
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/adam-binks/Musical-Wallpaper/releases/latest), then simply run the .jar file. No install required!

# Major issues
The first release only works on Windows 10.

# Future possibilities
- Improve look and feel of interface
- Provide suggestions for popular Spotify playlists and famous album covers
- Programatically update the wallpaper
- Cron job to check for updates to playlist and update wallpapers
